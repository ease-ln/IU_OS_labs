Let's consider the sequence of repeated values equal to n.
In our case n = 10, 50 and 100;
The sequence is repeated 1000/n is k, or k = 100, 20, 10 consequently,
then the cycle will be added to the cache
that means all other 1000-n calls will be hits.

example
n = 3
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 ...
hit 997 miss 3

if all values are unique than no hits.
